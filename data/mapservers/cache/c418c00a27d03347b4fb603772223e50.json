It is based on three sources: 1) A GIS modeling using a statistical estimation of peak-flow magnitude and a hydrological model using HydroSHEDS dataset and the Manning equation to estimate river stage for the calculated discharge value. 2) Observed flood from 1999 to 2007, obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO). 3) The frequency was set using the frequency from UNEP/GRID-Europe PREVIEW flood dataset. In area where no information was available, it was set to 50 years returning period. Unit is expected average number of event per 100 years. This product was designed by UNEP/GRID-Europe for the Global Assessment Report on Risk Reduction (GAR). It was modeled using global data.
