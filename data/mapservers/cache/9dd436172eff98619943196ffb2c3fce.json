This dataset shows stops where vehicles pick up or drop off riders, along with defining the stations and station entrances. This dataset, also known as GTFS static or static transit to differentiate it from the GTFS real-time extension, defines a common format for public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. GTFS \"feeds\" let public transit agencies publish their transit data and developers write applications that consume that data in an interoperable way. GTFS Data is stored in the National Transit Map database.
