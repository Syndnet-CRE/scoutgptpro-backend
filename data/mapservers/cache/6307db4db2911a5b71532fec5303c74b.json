This data layer can be used for a variety of purposes, including: the plotting of all historical LPST cases on maps; utilization by field personnel; and performing spatial analysis on how the sites affect their surroundings. The Petroleum Storage Tank (PST) Program oversees the assessment and cleanup of leaking petroleum storage tanks (LPSTs).  The program's mission is to supervise the cleanup of spills from regulated storage tanks by recording and evaluating all reported incidents of releases of petroleum and other hazardous substances from underground and above-ground storage tanks. The goal is to assure that the public is not exposed to hazardous levels of contamination by requiring the removal of the contamination to levels protective of human health and the environment.  Whenever possible, sites are handled by the responsible party (RP).  For sites that meet eligibility requirements, the PST remediation fund provides reimbursement for remediation of contamination.   For sites that cannot be handled by the RP, State Lead directs state contractors to conduct corrective action.", "Category": "", "AntialiasingMode": "None", "TextAntialiasingMode": "Force", "Version": "2.4.0", "Keywords": "LPST,Leaking Petroleum Storage Tank,PST,Petroleum Storage Tank,Remediation,TCEQ,Waste,Texas"}, "capabilities": "Map,Query,Data", "supportedQueryFormats": "JSON, geoJSON, PBF", "exportTilesAllowed": false, "referenceScale": 0.0, "datumTransformations": [{"geoTransforms": [{"wkid": 108190, "latestWkid": 108190, "transformForward": false, "name": "WGS_1984_(ITRF00)_To_NAD_1983"}]}, {"geoTransforms": [{"wkid": 108190, "latestWkid": 108190, "transformForward": true, "name": "WGS_1984_(ITRF00)_To_NAD_1983"}]}], "supportsDatumTransformation": true, "archivingInfo": {"supportsHistoricMoment": false}, "supportsClipping": true, "supportsSpatialFilter": true, "supportsTimeRelation": true, "supportsQueryDataElements": true, "maxRecordCount": 2000, "maxImageHeight": 4096, "maxImageWidth": 4096, "supportedExtensions": ""}
