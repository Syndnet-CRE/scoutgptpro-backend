{"currentVersion": 11.4, "cimVersion": "3.4.0", "id": 150, "name": "Transition Zone", "type": "Feature Layer", "description": "This dataset represents the geographic areas identified in TCEQ rules as being subject to regulation under theEdwards Aquifer Protection Program. The coverage was derived from existing official hard copy maps,containing regulatory boundaries based on previous geologic interpretation of the Edwards Aquifer Recharge,Transition, Contributing and Contributing Within the Transition zones, as defined in 30 TAC 213. This datasetcontains lines, area features and zone types attributes extended to all 90 USGS 7.5-minute maps under TCEQrules.Effective September 1, 2005, amended 30 TAC 213 changes the designation of portions of four areas in northernHays and southern Travis Counties. The commission adopts changes from transition zone to contributing zonewithin the transition zone, from transition zone to recharge zone and from recharge zone to transition zone.These changes were made to regulatory zone boundaries on the Oak Hill 7.5 Minute Quadrangle, the MountainCity 7.5 Minute Quadrangle, and the Buda 7.5 Minute Quadrangle.Also effective September 1, 2005, with this amendment, the commission is adopting changes from transitionzone to recharge zone, and contributing zone within the transition zone; in southern Hays and Comal Countiesfor areas along the eastern boundary of the recharge zone in the vicinity of the Blanco River, the City of SanMarcos, the City of New Braunfels, the community of Hunter and the community of Garden Ridge. Changes aredepicted on the Mountain City 7.5 Minute Quadrangle; on the San Marcos North 7.5 Minute Quadrangle; on theSan Marcos South 7.5 Minute Quadrangle; on the Hunter 7.5 Minute Quadrangle; and on the Bat Cave 7.5Minute Quadrangle.The commission also adopted changes along the western boundary of the recharge zone in southern Hays andComal Counties. Effective September 1, 2005, areas are changed from contributing zone to recharge zone in theGuadalupe River basin, and other areas in the Guadalupe River basin, and near Wimberley are changed fromrecharge zone to contributing zone. These changes occur on the Smithson Valley, Sattler, Devil\u2019s Backbone andWimberley 7.5 Minute Quadrangles. Another area near Hays City was changed to recharge zone fromcontributing zone, and is changed accordingly in the Driftwood 7.5 Minute Quadrangle.Purpose:This dataset provides TCEQ regional office and public with information on Edwards Aquifer Protection areasand types, including changes made to the boundaries by the most recent rules revisions, according to 30 TACCh. 213 (1999). This coverage is to facilitate the eventual replacement of the hard copy maps, historically usedto identify the geographic location of Edwards Aquifer Protection Program regulated areas.

This polygon was inadvertently left in after changesto the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone boundary were made to the adjoining Castle Hills quadrangle. Also, inthe vicinity of Cibolo Creek, the line for the Recharge Zone boundary does not match the line on the Bergheim7.5-minute quadrangle.On Austin West 7.5-minute quadrangle, the south line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on theOak Hill 7.5-minute quadrangle.On Bergheim 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on the CampBullis 7.5-minute quadrangle in the vicinity of Cibolo Creek.On Brackettville NE 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone in the southeast corner does notmatch with the line on the Elm Mountain 7.5-minute quadrangle.On Comanche Waterhole 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line onthe Sabinal NE 7.5-minute quadrangle.On Elm Mountain 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone in the northeast corner does not matchwith the line on the Bracketville NE 7.5-minute quadrangle.On Florence 7.5-minute quadrangle, the digitized line of the Con- tributing Zone deviates from the county lineon the DRG. In this case, the digitized line is believed to be correct due to con- flicting locations of the countyline on the adjacent Ding Dong 7.5-minute quadrangle which was photo-revised later than Florence or Mahomet.On Longhorn 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on the Schertz7.5-minute quadrangle.On Oak Hill 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on the AustinWest 7.5-minute quadrangle.On Mahomet 7.5-minute quadrangle, the digitized line of the Con- tributing Zone deviates from the county lineon the DRG. In this case, the digitized line is believed to be correct due to con- flicting locations of the countyline on the adjacent Ding Dong 7.5-minute quadrangle which was photo-revised later than Florence or Mahomet.On Quihi 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on the Riomedina7.5-minute quadrangle.On Riomedina 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on the Quihi7.5-minute quadrangle.On Sabinal NE 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on theComanche Waterhole 7.5-minute quadrangle.On San Marcos North 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on theWimberley 7.5-minute quadrangle.On Schertz 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on the Longhorn7.5-minute quadrangle.On Wimberley 7.5-minute quadrangle, the line of the Recharge Zone does not match with the line on the SanMarcos North 7.5-minute quadrangle.On this coverage, polygons and lines that are known to be incorrect or mismatched must remain until the rulesare amended, and all discrepancies are resolved.Supplemental_Information:The purpose of the TCEQ Rule 30, Texas Administrative Code(TAC), Chapter 213 is to regulate activitieshaving the potential for polluting the Edwards Aquifer and hydrologically connected surface streams in order toprotect existing and potential uses of ground- water and maintain Texas Surface Water Quality Standards. Thefollowing definitions are founded under Chapter:The Edwards Aquifer - portion of an arcuate belt of porous, waterbearing, predominantly carbonate rocks knownas the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer trending from west to east to north- east in Kinney, Uvalde,Medina, Bexar, Comal, Hays, Travis, and Williamson Counties; and is composed of the Salmon Peak Limestone,McKnight Formation, West Nueces Formation, Devil's River Limestone, Person Formation, Kainer Formation,Edwards Group and Georgetown Formation. The permeable aquifer units generally overlie the less- permeableGlen Rose Formation to the south, overlie the less- permeable Comanche Peak and Walnut formations north ofthe Colorado River, and underlie the less-permeable Del Rio Clay regionally. (30 TAC, \u00a7 213.3(8) )Recharge Zone - area where the stratigraphic units constituting the Edwards Aquifer crop out, including theoutcrops of geologic form- ations in proximity to the Edwards Aquifer where caves, sinkholes, faults, fractures,or other permeable features would create a potential for recharge to surface waters into the Edwards Aquifer. (30 TAC, \u00a7 213.3(25) )Transition Zone - area where geologic formations crop out in proximity to and south and southeast of therecharge zone and where faults, fractures, and other geologic features present a possible avenue for recharge ofsurface water to the Edwards Aquifer, including portions of the Del Rio Clay, Buda Limestone, Eagle FordGroup, Austin Chalk, Pecan Gap Chalk, and Anacacho Limestone. ( 30 TAC, \u00a7 213.3(34) )Contributing Zone - The area or watershed where runoff from precipitation flows downgradient to the rechargezone of the Edwards Aquifer. The Contributing Zone is located upstream (upgradient) and generally north andnorthwest of the Recharge Zone for the following counties:(A) all areas within Kinney County, except the area within the watershed draining to Segment 2304 of theRio Grande Basin;(B) all areas within Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, and Comal Counties;(C) all areas within Hays and Travis Counties, except the area within the watersheds draining to theColorado River above a point 1.3 miles upstream from Tom Miller Dam, Lake Austin at the confluence ofBarrow Brook Cove, Segment 1403 of the Colorado River Basin; and(D) all areas within Williamson County, except the area within the watersheds draining to the LampasasRiver above the dam at Stillhouse Hollow reservoir, Segment 1216 of the Brazos River Basin. ( 30 TAC, \u00a7213.22(2) )Contributing Zone Within the Transition Zone - The area or watershed where runoff from precipitation flowsdowngradient to the Recharge Zone of the Edwards Aquifer. The Contributing Zone Within the Transition Zoneis located downstream (downgradient) and generally south and southeast of the Recharge Zone and includesspecifically those areas where stratigraphic units not included in the Edwards Aquifer crop out at topographicallyhigher elevations and drain to stream courses where stratigraphic units of the Edwards Aquifer crop out and aremapped as Recharge Zone.( 30 TAC, \u00a7 213.22(3) )Time_Period_of_Content:Time_Period_Information:Range_of_Dates/Times:Beginning_Date: unknownEnding_Date: 20011102Currentness_Reference: ground condition", "geometryType": "esriGeometryPolygon", "sourceSpatialReference": {"wkid": 102740, "latestWkid": 2278, "xyTolerance": 0.003280833333333333, "zTolerance": 0.001, "mTolerance": 0.001, "falseX": -126725700, "falseY": -77828800, "xyUnits": 3048.0060960121928, "falseZ": 0, "zUnits": 1, "falseM": 0, "mUnits": 1}, "copyrightText": "Point_of_Contact:\nContact_Information:\nContact_Organization_Primary:\nContact_Organization: TCEQ Groundwater Planning & Assessment Team\nContact_Person: Cary Betz\nContact_Position: Geologist\nContact_Address:\nAddress_Type: mailing address\nAddress: MC-147, P.O.
