{"currentVersion": 10.81, "id": 0, "name": "Wetland", "type": "Raster Layer", "description": "The Global Wetlands Map covers the tropics and subtropics regions (40\u00b0 N to 60\u00b0 S; 180\u00b0 E to -180\u00b0 W), excluding small islands. This mapping is a hydro-geomorphological model based on an Expert System approach to estimate wetland areas, which relies on three biophysical indices related to wetland and peat formation: (1) long-term water supply exceeding atmospheric water demand; (2) annually or seasonally waterlogged soils; and (3) a geomorphological position where water is supplied and retained (Gumbricht et al. 2017).\n\nThe new version of the Global Tropical and Subtropical Wetlands Map was improved by generalization analysis such as Majority filter and Boundary Clean tools. The generalization analysis tools are used to clean up small erroneous data (eliminate isolated pixels) in the raster. The edges are smoothed by expanding and shrinking boundaries or by growing or shrinking zones based on the values within the neighborhood pixels. Moreover, an ArcGIS layer file was generated for facilitating the visualization.
